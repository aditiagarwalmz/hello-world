# hello-world
first repository :P

So I'm a noob here and I consider myself superior than other noobs. Why, you ask? I'm just a good learner.
okay, okay, I know I'm not giving a job interview here so here's a short description of me, by me.
I prefer to be called Mig Z. Captain over Aditi. (O Captain, my captain works too!) 
I also write sometimes, usually when I'm sad. Which is also why I prefer crying over laughing at nothing. (My life ain't sad)
You will see me using 'awesome' and 'cool' a lot in sentences.

bubye, absolutely no one!
